Data Scientist Blogpost "How Electric Vehicles took over the German second-hand carÂ market"

Udacity Nanodegree Program

The project was undertaken in coarse of the Udacity Nanodegree program Data Scientist. The projects consits of selecting a dataset, choosing three questions and answer them by analzing the data accordingly. The goal is of the project is to analyze the German Used-car market with a focus on the development of Electric Vehicles. The project has been built with Python 3.8.8 and Jupyter Notebook.



Project Structure

The project is based on the following structure:

German Car Stock EV-Analysis.ipynb: Python project code in Jupyter Notebook. The code is structured according to CRISP-DM and analyzes the German Used-car market and focuses on Electric Vehicles.
autoscout24-germany-dataset.csv. Includes the data retreived from Autoscout24 data from mid 2021 downloaded from Kaggle. In total 46,405 used vehicles with 9 different attributes are used in the analysis.  



Instructions to Run the Project

You need the following packages installed:

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
autoscout24-germany-dataset

Regarding the data, you may download the autoscout24-germany-dataset 2021 from Kaggle. Here's the download link: https://www.kaggle.com/ander289386/cars-germany
The dataset has to be put in the same folder as the project code.



Project Motivation

At its core, the main motivation is, based on a dataset of used vehicles, to analyze how the vehicle population in Germany is inexorably shifting toward electric vehicles. The key questions behind this project are:

1. How has the share of propulsion technologies in general and electric vehicles in specific changed over the last 10 years?
2. Offer electric vehicles less performance than their conventional counterparts? If so, became xEVs more powerful with the Ev-technology maturing?
3. There's "range anxiety" associated with the use of electric vehicles. How have electric vehicles been used with respect to the vehicle kilometeres travelled per anno [VKT/a] compared to gasoline powered vehicles? Are EVs only used on shorter distances and therefore have shorter total mileage?
